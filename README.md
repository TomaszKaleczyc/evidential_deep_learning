# Evidential Deep Learning with PyTorch
This repository contains a demontstration of how to build, train and evaluate a neural network capable of measuring epistemic uncertainty as proposed by the authors of [*Evidential Deep Learning to Quantify Classification Uncertainty*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01768.pdf)
